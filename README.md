# IOS_Projects
This repository will contain all the IOS applications I'm working on under my Udemy course with Devslopes.

HelloWorld : Display name image and background image with push of a button.
MiraclePills : Simple project providing the basic introduction to labels, TextFields and other Views.
ScrollView : A project which shows how to use ScrollView in IOS,
StackView : A Project that shows how to support multiple screens using StackView.
SegueDemo : A Project to show how to use segue and pass data between different Views.


All these projects are part of the course. Thanks to Mark Price. Iâ€™m getting a better insights at IOS Development.
